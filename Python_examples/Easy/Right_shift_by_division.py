# Right Shift by Division
# The right shift operation is similar to floor division by powers of two.

# Sample calculation using the right shift operator ( >> ):
# 80 >> 3 = floor(80/2^3) = floor(80/8) = 10
# -24 >> 2 = floor(-24/2^2) = floor(-24/4) = -6
# -5 >> 1 = floor(-5/2^1) = floor(-5/2) = -3

# Write a function that mimics (without the use of >>) the right shift operator and returns the result from the two given integers.

# Examples
# shift_to_right(80, 3) ➞ 10
# shift_to_right(-24, 2) ➞ -6
# shift_to_right(-5, 1) ➞ -3
# shift_to_right(4666, 6) ➞ 72
# shift_to_right(3777, 6) ➞ 59
# shift_to_right(-512, 10) ➞ -1

# Notes
# There will be no negative values for the second parameter y.
# This challenge is more like recreating of the right shift operation, thus, the use of the operator directly is prohibited.
# Alternatively, you can solve this challenge via recursion.
# A recursive version of this challenge can be found via this link.

## MY SOLUTION

def shift_to_right(x, y):
    answer = (x/(2**y))
    if answer % 1 == .5:
	    if answer < 0:
		    answer = answer - .5
        else:
		    answer = answer + .5
    return int(answer)
